# Shopping_Cart
 ECE5721-Final Project - Winter 2022

## *Implement Smart Shopping Cart with Billing System*

The Shopping cart with a built-in billing system features (Refer Figure 1: Block Diagram of Shopping cart with Billing System) ARM Cortex M0 based FRDM-KL25Z EVK, Wi-Fi module, Bar-code and QR code reader, LCD module, HMI switches (Menu/Add/Remove), LEDâ€™s for user indicators. When a person places any product on the trolley, it is scanned and this
information is sent to server via Wi-Fi module to fetch the product's cost, name, and expiration date and this information is displayed on LCD screen. The total cost will be
added to the final check out bill. The bill is stored in the microcontrollers memory. Once the purchase is complete, the purchase details are sent to the customer through the Sever.
